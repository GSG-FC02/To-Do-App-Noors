## The Purpose
Welcome to our To-Do-App Webiste
We have designed it for You!
One of the most important reasons for keeping a to-do list is the organization,
Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. 
Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.

# Team Members Journey while desiging (From the start to the end)

In our journey to finish designing the site we will divide the work into steps:

1. The first step will be creating a repository on GitHub
2. The second step will be dividing the work and creating issues regarding every issue
3. The third step will be assinging every issue to a member who will start working on it 
4. after the team member finishes his work on a certain issue, we will push it to the Github repository and wait every team member to view his work and approve it or request changes
5. if the pull request was approved and merged, the member will move to another issue to work on it.
6. the previous step will be repeated until the site finishes.



Our team members will use **HTML5** & **CSS** & JS .
